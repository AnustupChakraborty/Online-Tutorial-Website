        when –
        <br>-milk is left at room temperature during summers.
        <br>-an iron tawa/pan/nail is left exposed to humid atmosphere.
        <br>-grapes get fermented.
        <br>-food is cooked.
        <br>-food gets digested in our body.
        <br>-we respire.
        In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial
        substance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical
        and chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical
        change occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.
        You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a
        chemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction
        has taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to
        these questions.

        <td class="mat">Activity 1.1 can be described as –<br> when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in
            oxygen, it gets converted to magnesium oxide. This description of a
            chemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a
            shorter form. <br>The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a
            word-equation.
            The word-equation for the above reaction would be –<br>
            <u>Magnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium oxide</u> (1.1)<br>
            The substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),
            magnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is
            magnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.<br>
            A word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an
            arrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand
            side (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are
            written on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.<br>
            The arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of
            the reaction.

    <td class="mat">Is there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?
        Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use
        chemical formulae instead of words.<br> A chemical equation represents a
        chemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and
        magnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –<br>
        Mg + O2 → MgO (1.2)<br>
        Count and compare the number of atoms of each element on the
        LHS and RHS of the arrow. <br>Is the number of atoms of each element the
        same on both the sides? <br>If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,
        then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on
        both sides of the equation. <br>Such a chemical equation is a skeletal
        chemical equation for a reaction. <br>Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical
        equation for the burning of magnesium in air.</td>

                You have learnt in your previous classes that the sour and bitter
                tastes of food are due to acids and bases, respectively, present in them.
                If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after
                overeating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon
                juice, vinegar or baking soda solution?<br>
                n Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy?
                Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of
                acids and bases to nullify each other’s effect.<br>
                n Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting
                them.<br>
                You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour
                of blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of
                the red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another
                such indicator.<br> Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth
                becomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed
                on it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of
                water. <br>You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and
                phenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.</td>

            <td class="mat">Note that the metal in the above reactions displaces hydrogen atoms
                from the acids as hydrogen gas and forms a compound called a salt.<br>
                Thus, the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as –<br>
                Acid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas<br>
                Can you now write the equations for the reactions you have observed?
                The reaction that takes place can be written as follows.<br>
                2NaOH(aq) + Zn(s) → Na2ZnO2<br>

                 (Sodium zincate)<br>
                You find again that hydrogen is formed in the reaction. However,
                such reactions are not possible with all metals.</td>

           <td class="mat">In Section 2.1 we have seen that all acids have similar chemical
            properties. What leads to this similarity in properties? <br>We saw in Activity
            2.3 that all acids generate hydrogen gas on reacting with metals, so
            hydrogen seems to be common to all acids.<br> Let us perform an Activity to
            investigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic.<br>
            The bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in Fig. 2.3.
            <br>But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct
            electricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric
            current through the solution. The electric current is carried through the
            acidic solution by ions.<br>
            Acids contain H+
             ion as cation and anion such as Cl–
             in HCl, NO3
            –
             in
            HNO3
            , SO2–
            4
            in H2
            SO4
            , CH3COO–
             in CH3COOH. Since the cation present in
            acids is H+
            , this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+
            (aq), in
            solution, which are responsible for their acidic properties</td>

                    unable to see anything in a dark room. On lighting up the room,
                    things become visible. <br>What makes things visible? During the day, the
                    sunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it.
                    This reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things.
                    We are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmitted<br>
                    through it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena
                    associated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling
                    of stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium
                    and so on. <br>A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.
                    By observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may
                    conclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. <br>The fact that a small
                    source of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this
                    straight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.

                <td class="mat">The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or
                    outwards. A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards,
                    that is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.<br>
                    A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called
                    a convex mirror. The schematic representation of these mirrors is shown
                    in Fig. 10.1. You may note in these diagrams that the back
                    of the mirror is shaded.<br>
                    You may now understand that the surface of the spoon
                    curved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror
                    and the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be
                    approximated to a convex mirror.<br>
                    Before we move further on spherical mirrors, we need to
                    recognise and understand the meaning of a few terms.<br> These
                    terms are commonly used in discussions about spherical
                    mirrors. The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical
                    mirror is a point called the pole. It lies on the surface of the
                    mirror. The pole is usually represented by the letter P.<br>
                    The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere.
                    This sphere has a centre. <br>This point is called the centre of curvature of
                    the spherical mirror. It is represented by the letter C. <br>Please note that the
                    centre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting
                    surface. The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.
                    However, it lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror. You may
                    note this in Fig.10.2 (a) and (b).<br>The radius of the sphere of which the
                    reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius
                    of curvature of the mirror. It is represented by the letter R. <br>You may note
                    that the distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. Imagine a straight
                    line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical
                    mirror. This line is called the principal axis. <br>Remember that principal
                    axis is normal to the mirror at its pole.</td>

                may even catch fire. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is converged
                at a point, as a sharp, bright spot by the mirror. <br>In fact, this spot of light
                is the image of the Sun on the sheet of paper. This point is
                the focus of the concave mirror. The heat produced due to
                the concentration of sunlight ignites the paper.<br> The distance
                of this image from the position of the mirror gives the
                approximate value of focal length of the mirror.<br>
                Let us try to understand this observation with the help
                of a ray diagram.<br>
                Observe Fig.10.2 (a) closely. A number of rays parallel
                to the principal axis are falling on a concave mirror. Observe
                the reflected rays. <br>They are all meeting/intersecting at a
                point on the principal axis of the mirror. This point is called
                the principal focus of the concave mirror.<br> Similarly, observe
                Fig. 10.2 (b). How are the rays parallel to the principal axis,
                reflected by a convex mirror?<br> The reflected rays appear to
                come from a point on the principal axis. This point is called
                the principal focus of the convex mirror. <br>The principal focus
                is represented by the letter F. The distance between the
                pole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called
                the focal length. It is represented by the letter f</td>
