    <td class="mat">The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do somethingwith multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite numbercan be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way—this important fact is theFundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state andunderstand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics.We use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, weuse it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as2 ,    3 and 5. Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimalexpansion  of  a  rational  number,  say  (0)pqq≠,  is  terminating  and  when  it  is  non-terminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominatorq of pq. You will see that the prime factorisation of q will completely reveal the natureof the decimal expansion of pq.So let us begin our exploration</td>

        <td class="mat">Given  positive  integers  a  and  b,there  exist  unique  integers  q  and  r  satisfying  a  =  bq  +  r,0  ≤  r  <  b.This result was perhaps known for a long time, but was first recorded in Book VIIof Euclid’s Elements. Euclid’s division algorithm is based on this lemma.Euclid’s division algorithm is a technique to compute the Highest Common Factor(HCF) of two given positive integers. Recall that the HCF of two positive integers aand b is the largest positive integer d that divides both a and b.Let us see how the algorithm works, through an example first. Suppose we needto find the HCF of the integers 455 and 42. We start with the larger integer, that is,455. Then we use Euclid’s lemma to get455 =42 × 10 + 35Now consider the divisor 42 and the remainder 35, and apply the division lemmato get42 =35 × 1 + 7Now consider the divisor 35 and the remainder 7, and apply the division lemmato get35 =7 × 5 + 0Notice that the remainder has become zero, and we cannot proceed any further.We claim that the HCF of 455 and 42 is the divisor at this stage, i.e., 7. You can easilyverify this by listing all the factors of 455 and 42. Why does this method work? Itworks because of the following result.

            <td class="mat">Sridharacharya (C.E. 1025) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula,(as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completingthe  square.  An    Arab  mathematician  Al-Khwarizmi  (about  C.E.  800)  also  studiedquadratic  equations  of  different  types.  Abraham  bar  Hiyya  Ha-Nasi,  in  his  book‘Liber  embadorum’  published  in  Europe  in  C.E.  1145  gave  complete  solutions  ofdifferent quadratic equations.In this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of findingtheir roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily lifesituations</td>

            <td class="mat">Consider  the  quadratic  equation  2x2  –  3x  +  1  =  0.  If  we  replace  x  by  1  on  theLHS  of  this  equation,  we  get  (2  ×  12)  –  (3  ×  1)  +  1  =  0  =  RHS  of  the  equation.We say that 1 is a root of the quadratic equation 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. This also means that1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial 2x2 – 3x + 1.In  general,  a  real  number  α  is  called  a  root  of  the  quadratic  equationax2 + bx + c = 0, a≠ 0 if aα2 + bα + c = 0. We also say that x =ααααα is a solution ofthe quadratic equation, or that ααααα satisfies the quadratic equation. Note that thezeroes  of  the  quadratic  polynomial  ax2  +  bx  +  c  and  the  roots  of  the  quadraticequation  ax2  +  bx  +  c  =  0  are  the  same.You have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at mosttwo zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots.You have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splittingtheir middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadraticequation. Let us see how.</td>
